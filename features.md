- Error handling middleware

# Extras

Nice! A Kanban app with fixed columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) can still have plenty of useful options besides renaming columns. Here are some ideas, grouped by functionality:

---

### 🔹 Column-Level Options (per column)

1. **Add Task** – quickly add a new card directly into that column.
2. **Sort Tasks** – choose how to order cards (e.g., by priority, due date, created date, custom order).
3. **Filter/Show Only** – toggle filters to show only certain tasks (e.g., by tag, assignee, deadline).
4. **Collapse/Expand Column** – hide a column to save screen space.
5. **WIP (Work-in-Progress) Limit** – set a maximum number of cards allowed in the column (useful for “In Progress”).
6. **Bulk Actions** – move/archive multiple tasks at once.
7. **Archive/Empty Column** – remove all completed tasks (common for the “Done” column).
8. **Column Color/Theme** – visually differentiate columns.
9. **Export Column** – export tasks in that column as CSV, JSON, or Markdown.
10. **Column Statistics** – show counts (e.g., number of tasks, overdue tasks, average time spent in this column).

---

### 🔹 Task Interaction Options (within columns)

* **Drag & Drop Reordering** – change order of tasks manually.
* **Multi-select Tasks** – move, delete, or assign multiple at once.
* **Quick Add Subtasks** – add checklist items inside tasks.
* **Set Priority/Labels** – directly apply labels from the column menu.

---

### 🔹 Automation/Workflow Options

* **Auto-move on Condition** – e.g., tasks in “In Progress” move to “Done” if marked complete.
* **Reminders / Notifications** – column-based reminders (e.g., daily summary of “To Do”).
* **Integration Options** – sync only tasks in a certain column with external tools (calendar, Slack, etc.).

---

👉 The minimal must-haves are **Add Task**, **Sort**, **WIP Limit**, and **Archive/Empty Column**. The rest depends on how lightweight vs. feature-rich you want your app to be.

Do you want this Kanban app to stay **simple like Trello** or more **powerful like Jira**? That’ll help me suggest the right balance of options.

Got it ✅ — so your Kanban app is more of an **internal company/branch system**, with a clear **role separation**:

* **Admins:** Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) on tasks
* **Employees:** Can *only see* their assigned tasks and *update status* (move between columns)

That means column options should mostly support **admins**, while employees should get a very simplified interface.

---

### 🔹 Admin Column Options

Since admins control the system, each column can have:

1. **Add Task** – create a new task directly in that column.
2. **Bulk Move/Assign** – move multiple tasks between columns or reassign ownership.
3. **Sort/Filter Tasks** – by employee, priority, due date, etc.
4. **WIP Limit (Work-In-Progress)** – restrict how many tasks can be in "In Progress".
5. **Archive/Empty Column** – clear “Done” tasks after review.
6. **Column Reports/Stats** – see how many tasks are in each stage, bottlenecks, average time in column.
7. **Column Lock/Restrictions** – e.g., only admins can move tasks into “Done”.
8. **Export Data** – export all tasks in a column (CSV/Excel/PDF).
9. **Notifications** – enable alerts when tasks enter a specific column (e.g., “New tasks added to To Do”).
10. **Custom Tags or Labels** – assign tags at the column level (e.g., “urgent”).

---

### 🔹 Employee Column Options

Employees should have fewer options, limited to their tasks:

1. **Update Task Status** – drag/move their task between To Do → In Progress → Done.
2. **View Task Details** – description, due date, attachments, etc.
3. **Add Comments/Notes** – communicate progress to admins.
4. **Subtasks/Checklists** – tick off steps within their task.
5. **Mark Task Complete** – final step before moving to “Done”.
6. **Personal Filters** – see only “My Tasks” or filter by deadline/priority.

---

### 🔹 Optional (Advanced) Features

* **Column Audit Trail** – history of who moved which task and when (for accountability).
* **Approval Workflow** – employees can move to "In Progress", but only admins can approve "Done".
* **Performance Metrics** – track average completion time per employee or per column.

---

👉 In short:

* **Admins** get *management tools* (creation, assignment, limits, reports).
* **Employees** get *execution tools* (status updates, progress notes).

Would you like me to sketch out a **permissions matrix** (columns × role actions) so it’s crystal clear what each role can/can’t do?
